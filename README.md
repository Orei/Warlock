# Warlock
Personal project of mine developed over 3-4 weeks.
Networked Unity arena-brawler based on the *Warlock* custom game for *Warcraft III*.
Utilizing [Mirror](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror), a community-driven reimplementation of the deprecated UNET.

## Purpose
* Developed in order to get a better understanding of networking.
* Creating a variety of assets outside of my primary discipline in order to explore the different workflows and test my abilities:
